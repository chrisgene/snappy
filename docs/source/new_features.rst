Potential New Features:
=======================

The SNAPPY team welcomes suggestions for improvements from the user community. SNAPPY developers plan to implement additional functionality into SNAPPY as the need for such functionality arises. To date, potential improvements include:

- Different scoring systems (ex: jaccard similarity coefficient, Kulczynski measure) to enable a more robust scoring system around haplogroup calling. 
- Development of supporting scripts to download and integrate up-to-date data from ISOGG.
