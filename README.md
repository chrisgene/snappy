# SNAPPY
A fast y-haplogroup caller for SNP data.

SNAPPY is designed to easily call phylogenetic haplogroups on the Y, particularly from Y-SNP data derived from MEGA and similar arrays, using plink-formatted genotype data.

Check out the user manual, and download the test data and reference files to use our tree data, derived from phylogenetic information present on ISOGG.org.
