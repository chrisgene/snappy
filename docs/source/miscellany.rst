Potential New Features:
=======================

The SNAPPY team welcomes suggestions for improvements from the user community. SNAPPY developers plan to implement additional functionality into SNAPPY as the need for such functionality arises. To date, potential improvements include:

- Different scoring systems (ex: jaccard similarity coefficient, Kulczynski measure) to enable a more robust scoring system around haplogroup calling. 
- Instructions to build a singularity container that includes SNAPPY as well as all programs and package dependencies needed to run SNAPPY.
